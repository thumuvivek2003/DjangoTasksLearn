### ‚úÖ How to Learn This Efficiently:

* Use one of these platforms: **YouTube (e.g. "Code With Mosh", "Traversy Media")**, or sites like **RealPython**, **W3Schools**, or **official Django docs**.
* Practice on **mini-projects** after every few steps.
* Keep using **PostgreSQL via pgAdmin or DBeaver** to see your data.
